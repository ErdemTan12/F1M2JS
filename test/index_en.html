     <p> The Renaissance is an explosion of renewal. During the Great Iconoclasm, churches were stormed and alot of art was destroyed, shocking the christian world. But it helped art develop. Artists became celebrities and their names would be known all across Europe. Lucas van Leyden for example, a big story teller, became a very well known celebrity. </p>

      <p> In the 17th century, the Dutch seperated themselves from the Spanish and got rid of their catholic beliefs and became protestant. The early 17th century was the perfect time for the Dutch to travel to Asia for the first time looking for spices, founding the VOC in the process. This gives the economy a huge boost and an increase in the quantity and quality of art. </p>

    <p> The florescence of Dutch art ends in the 18th century. But it kickstarts a fascination for everything that happened in European countries around us. Never before have we seen so much attention for interior design where ones own home is turned into an artwork. Everything fits together so well, from the ceiling to the fireplace, the furniture, the candles and the tableware. For that environment artists made items. They were made in styles like rococo or classicism. </p>

     <p> Napoleon is defeated at Waterloo and The Netherlands becomes a kingdom. The 19th century is the beginning of the modern Netherlands. You can see how the style of paintings changes: fast strokes from Vincent van Gogh, the colorexplosion of the dot style of Jan Toorop. </p>

      <div class="column animate-top1">
      <p> The 20th century shows a whirlwind of developement: the airplane was invented, but it was only seen as abstract art at the time. For the first time, artists make a difference. They paint more than what is around them. No more self portraits or landscapes, just lines and blocks in bright colors. Piet Mondriaan and his group of artists called the Stijl is an important example of this. Artists start seeing themselves as shapers of the world, more specifically a new world in the future that is much better, righteous and freeer. They create utopian visions, like Constant Nieuwenhuis with his new 'city' called Nieuw Babylon.</p>
